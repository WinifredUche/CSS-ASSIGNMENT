    <p >Saying that we live in a “digital age” is a bit cliché, but there’s no denying that the internet and social media have revolutionized the way we interact.
This dependence on digital tools also spills over into the business world. The pandemic has accelerated online shopping trends, and countless companies 
rely on SaaS and PaaS tools to keep their businesses running smoothly. For entrepreneurs, this reliance on technology creates new opportunities.
 With this transition, a new class of entrepreneurs have arisen – The Techpreneurs. Technopreneurship is a combination of technological advancements and entrepreneurial skills.
 From Facebook to Google, from Skype to Snapchat, tech entrepreneurs have fostered new ways of creating value & doing business, while also creating entirely new industries of their own.
The tech sector has become one of the most important sectors in several nations worldwide. A sector that creates huge investments & plenty of economic benefits – not to mention the
 positive impact it has on people’s lives. Techpreneurs successfully leverage high-end technology and advanced business practices to reinvent and reshape the society around them.
The only requisites to being a successful technopreneur are the ability to identify the real problems and the vision to transform them into business opportunities by intelligent 
use of technology and refined business acumen. In the past, the entrepreneurship playbook was an engineer coming out of an IIT & starting up. That is no longer the case. As internet 
adoption gets deeper & widespread, where entrepreneurs come from & the problems they solve are spreading beyond metros. At Atria University, you will explore how entrepreneurs match 
promising technology with customer needs to launch successful new businesses. Using real-world examples, you will apply critical thinking to commercialize technologies and learn about
 the venture creation process from founders, funders, and industry experts.</p>
